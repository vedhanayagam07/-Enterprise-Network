Small Enterprise Network with VLANs and Cloud Connectivity
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a small enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal was to implement a structured and secure network with VLAN segmentation, basic routing, and simulated cloud connectivity to reflect real-world enterprise networking scenarios.

Objectives

Design a scalable small enterprise network

Implement VLAN segmentation for departments

Configure routing between VLANs

Apply IP addressing and subnetting

Simulate secure cloud connectivity

Practice network troubleshooting and monitoring

Technologies Used

Cisco Packet Tracer

Networking concepts (VLANs, Routing, Switching)

IP Addressing & Subnetting

Basic Cloud Networking

Network Design

The network includes:

Multiple departments connected via VLANs

Switch configuration for VLAN segmentation

Router configuration for inter-VLAN routing

End devices (PCs) for testing connectivity

Simulated cloud network for external access

Features Implemented

VLAN creation and assignment

Trunking between switches

Inter-VLAN routing configuration

IP addressing and subnet planning

Connectivity testing using ping and simulation tools

Basic security rules for network access

Troubleshooting of routing and VLAN issues

 Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I gained practical experience in:

Designing enterprise network topologies

Configuring VLANs and routing

Troubleshooting connectivity issues
